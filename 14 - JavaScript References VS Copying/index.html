    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);  // show that age2 was populated by val so unchanged

    let name = 'one'
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'two'
    console.log(name, name2);// same as above name2 unchanged

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const players2 = players
    console.log(players , players2);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players.push('Zombie!!!!!')

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players , players2); 

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team1 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players)
    team2[0] = 'team2'

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players]
    team3[0] = 'team3'

    // or array.from
    const team4 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team1[0] = 'team1'
    team2[0] = 'team2'
    team3[0] = 'team3'
    team4[0] = 'team4'
    console.log(players, players2, team1, team2, team3, team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person
    person2.number = 66

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {number : 99})
    console.log(person, person2, person3)

    // object ...spread
    const person4 = {...person, number: 13}
    console.log(person4);


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const array1 = [1,2,[3,4]]
    const array2 = [...array1]
    array1[0] = 'Hello' // only updates array1
    array1[2].push(5) // update shows in array1 and 2
    console.log( array1, array2)

    // for objects
    const obj1 = {
      name: 'Test',
      nested: {
        test: true
      }
    }
    const obj2 = Object.assign({}, obj1, {name: 'copy'})
    obj1.nested.test = false // change shows in obj1 and obj2
    console.log(obj1, obj2)

    // a Clone Deep function will allow a deep copy

    // You can also convert to JSON and back (poor mans deep clone):
    const obj3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1))
    obj3.name= 'JSON'
    obj3.nested.new = true // won't update obj1 or obj2
    console.log(obj1, obj3)
